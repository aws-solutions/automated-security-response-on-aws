  ### Document name - AWS-ConfigureS3BucketVersioning
    
  ## What does this document do?
  Configures the versioning attributes for the S3 bucket you specify. This automation can be used to enable or disable versioning for an S3 bucket depending on the value you specify for the VersioningState parameter.
    
  ## Input Parameters
  * BucketName: (Required) The name of the Amazon S3 bucket you want to configure versioning for.
  * VersioningState: (Optional) Applied to the VersioningConfiguration.Status. When set to '*Enabled*', this process enables versioning for the objects in the bucket, all objects added to the bucket receive a unique version ID. When set to '*Suspended*', this process dsables versioning for the objects in the bucket, all objects added to the bucket receive the version ID null.
  * AutomationAssumeRole: (Optional) The ARN of the role that allows Automation to perform the actions on your behalf.
