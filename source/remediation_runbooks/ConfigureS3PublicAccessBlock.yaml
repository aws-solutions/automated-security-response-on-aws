  ### Document Name - AWSConfigRemediation-ConfigureS3PublicAccessBlock

  ## What does this document do?
  This document is used to create or modify the S3 [PublicAccessBlock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html#access-control-block-public-access-options) configuration for an AWS account.

  ## Input Parameters
  * AccountId: (Required) Account ID of the account for which the S3 Account Public Access Block is to be configured.
  * RestrictPublicBuckets: (Optional) Specifies whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE restricts access to buckets with public policies to only AWS services and authorized users within this account.
    * Default: "true"
  * BlockPublicAcls: (Optional) Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public access control lists (ACLs) for buckets in this account.
    * Default: "true"
  * IgnorePublicAcls: (Optional) Specifies whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes Amazon S3 to ignore all public ACLs on buckets in this account and any objects that they contain.
    * Default: "true"
  * BlockPublicPolicy: (Optional) Specifies whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for buckets in this account. Setting this element to TRUE causes Amazon S3 to reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows public access.
    * Default: "true"
  * AutomationAssumeRole: (Required) The ARN of the role that allows Automation to perform the actions on your behalf.

  ## Output Parameters
  * ConfigureS3PublicAccessBlock.Output - JSON formatted response from the ConfigureS3PublicAccessBlock script.
